"""
CHAR method-registry and conditional-logic-framework enumerations.

Single source of truth for the governance-method vocabulary shared by the
aigov-framework method registry (``method_registry.yaml``), the CLF v0.6.0
rule grammar (``process-domain-registry.json``), and coreapp's MethodRoute
work (coreapp ADR-031). Authored per aigov-framework ADR-011 §5 and the
Phase 2 handoff (ASHKBAPP-99).

Ontology binding follows the ADR-002 convention: ``x_ontology_scheme`` is
asserted on the model fields that use these enums (``methods.py``), and the
CI guard (``tests/methods/test_ontology_binding.py``) checks every member
resolves in its scheme in ``ashmatics-unified-ontology.ttl``.

Value convention: the five ash facet-scheme enums (and ``ModelClass``) use the
ontology concept LOCAL NAMES (``ap-predictive``, ``of-categorical``, ...) —
these are the canonical CHAR concept IDs used throughout method_registry.yaml
and CLF condition expressions. The ash concepts' ``skos:notation`` values
predate CHAR and differ (``"predictive"``), which is why the binding guard
accepts local names. ``MethodFamily`` values match the family concepts'
``skos:notation`` exactly (minted together in ontology ADR-006).
