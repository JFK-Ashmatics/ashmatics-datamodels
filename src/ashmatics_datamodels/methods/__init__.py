CHAR governance-method contracts (aigov-framework ADR-011, ASHKBAPP-99).

The method stratum of the CHAR vocabulary spine: exemplar method
definitions with SKOS-bound applicability, shared method sets, the
client-approved variant, and the CLF v0.6.0 rule-grammar extensions shared
with coreapp MethodRoute (ADR-031).
