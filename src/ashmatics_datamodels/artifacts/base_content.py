Base reference-content contracts (the KB side of the artifact plane).

aigov-framework ADR-006 (Policy/Process Base Persistence and Customer
Instantiation Strategy, Accepted 2025-08-11) layer 1: the Knowledge Base is
the system of record for cross-tenant base content — Markdown artifacts in
blob storage with content-addressed IDs and SemVer, metadata in Postgres,
and compiled JSON views for agent/wizard consumption.

Ported field-for-field from the aigov-framework's legacy
``ash-gov-process-model/models_pydantic/pydantic_models.py`` (ASHKBAPP-99
reconciliation; that file is now a deprecation shim re-exporting these).
The port is faithful: no fields added or removed. Inheriting
``AshMaticsBaseModel`` tightens behavior (extra fields forbidden,
assignment validation) per house standard. Ontology bindings beyond
provenance notes are deferred to the ADR-002 promotion gate — the ``type``
Literal overlaps ``ash:DocumentKindScheme`` governance kinds but with
different stored values, so binding it is a redesign, not a port.
