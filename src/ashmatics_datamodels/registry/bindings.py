Ontology-anchoring declarations for the registry vocabularies (ADR-002).

The org module hangs ``x_ontology_*`` annotations on Pydantic model fields;
the registry vocabularies have no Pydantic contract yet (the persisted shape
is coreapp's Django model per ADR-036), so the bindings live in this table and
``tests/registry/test_ontology_binding.py`` iterates it directly. Same intent,
same CI teeth: drift between an enum and its scheme is a failed test, not a
silent bug.

Status vocabulary:

- ``BOUND``   — the scheme exists in the ontology; the guard enforces every
  member (minus declared extras) is a concept of it.
- ``PENDING`` — the anchor is being authored in ashmatics-ontology; the guard
  skips loudly so the gap stays visible in every test run. Flip to ``BOUND``
  with the scheme CURIE the moment the scheme lands.
- ``PRODUCT`` — deliberately product-level vocabulary with no anchor planned;
  recorded so "unanchored" is always a decision, never an oversight.

    retired, and that test failure is the reminder.
