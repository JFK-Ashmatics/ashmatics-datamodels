AI System Registry rule vocabularies (ASHFORGE-412, ADR-036 §2.5).

The vocabularies the AI System Registry writes and the governance rule files
will read. Stored per-entry: category, AI type, sourcing channel, deployment
topology (plus ``DeploymentStatus``, bound ahead of coreapp adoption).
Derived, never stored: the SRS-REG-15a obligation triad (``RegistrySourcing``),
the two org-level rollups (``PortfolioSizeBucket``, ``OrgSourcingMix``), and the
CHAR content selector (``SystemClass``, ADR-015) — their derivations live in
:mod:`.derive`. This module is the single source of
truth: coreapp's Django ``TextChoices`` (``core/models/ai_registry.py``) and
the frontend's ``aiRegistryTaxonomies.ts`` are downstream mirrors pinned by
parity tests, and scoring-rule YAMLs must test only these values.

Every value here is a rule-engine key. Changing one is a vocabulary decision
that moves data migrations and rule files with it — never a rename
(SRS-REG-AC-6).

Ontology anchoring is declared in :mod:`.bindings` and enforced by
``tests/registry/test_ontology_binding.py``. Current state (ontology v2.3.0 /
ADR-007): category, AI type, sourcing channel, and deployment status are
BOUND; deployment topology and the derived rollups are deliberately
product-level. ``SystemClass`` is PENDING (ADR-015 open item 5).

from enum import Enum


class RegistryCategory(str, Enum):
    """
    What the system's output is *about* — the customer-facing classification,
    and the registry's most load-bearing vocabulary.

    Decision test: **does the system's output assert something about an
    individual patient's condition or care?**

    - ``CLINICAL`` — yes: detection, diagnosis, treatment planning, monitoring,
      rehab, follow-up. An ICH triage tool is clinical — it detects hemorrhage
      in a specific patient's scan — even though its visible action is worklist
      reordering (cf. ``ash:cp-triage``, a ClinicalPurposeScheme concept).
    - ``OPERATIONAL`` — no individual-patient assertion; the object is care
      delivery itself: patient/staff/resource flow, capacity, census
      forecasting, care-pathway metrics.
    - ``ADMINISTRATIVE`` — the business of healthcare: revenue cycle, coding,
      supply chain, inventory, call-center and refill agents, back-office
      documentation.

    Only the clinical / non-clinical edge carries governance obligations, and
    :func:`ashmatics_datamodels.registry.derive.is_clinical_use` is the
    rule-facing predicate for it — the SRS-REG-03 ``clinical_use`` boolean is
    DERIVED, never stored (ASHFORGE-412 AC-2). The operational /
    administrative boundary is deliberately descriptive-only: a borderline
    call there miscategorizes nothing that rules act on.

    Binds to ``ash:ScopeZoneScheme`` (ontology v2.3.0 / ADR-007, concepts
    ``ash:sz-*``). The ontology allows a system to span zones (multi-value);
    the registry stores ONE primary zone for now — the safe direction, since
    single → multi is an additive migration and multi → single is lossy.
    """

    CLINICAL = "clinical"
    OPERATIONAL = "operational"
    ADMINISTRATIVE = "administrative"


class SystemClass(str, Enum):
    """
    CHAR system class — *what the system does for the organization*, as CHAR's
    content layer asks it (ADR-015). DERIVED from :class:`RegistryCategory` by
    :func:`ashmatics_datamodels.registry.derive.system_class`, never stored:
    the registry stays the single written source, exactly as ``clinical_use``
    and the obligation triad do.

    CHAR splits its corpus into a scope-neutral **core** and **system classes**
    that specialize it. The class is the selector — ``{{system.class}}`` in the
    Conditional Logic Framework, ``class_applicability`` on registry entries —
    so a two-value axis is what the content needs:

    - ``CLINICAL`` — ``RegistryCategory.CLINICAL``. The flagship class; the
      clinical content CHAR ships today.
    - ``ADMINISTRATIVE_OPERATIONAL`` — ``RegistryCategory.OPERATIONAL`` and
      ``RegistryCategory.ADMINISTRATIVE``, collapsed. ADR-015 open item 1 keeps
      these one class id until the second class's content plan shows whether
      revenue cycle, supply chain and facilities actually diverge. The three-way
      :class:`RegistryCategory` remains the stored truth, so splitting later
      widens this derivation rather than re-classifying any entry.

    Three things this is NOT, each of which it has already been mistaken for:

    - **Not a risk tier.** ADR-015 D1 forbids reading "administrative" as
      "low risk"; a prior-authorization denial agent is administrative and
      high-risk. Risk tiering operates *within* a class.
    - **Not ``modelClass``.** ``{{system.class}}`` and ``{{system.modelClass}}``
      sit side by side in the CLF ``system`` scope and are unrelated axes:
      ``modelClass`` is the *technique* (cnn, transformer, tree_ensemble).
      ADR-015's Consequences names reviewer confusion between the two as a real
      failure mode.
    - **Not agentic.** How the system *acts* is
      :class:`RegistryAIType` / ``{{system.actionAuthority}}``, orthogonal to
      what it does. An ambient scribe that files orders is clinical and agentic.

    Values are kebab-case (ADR-015 D4, one canonical spelling), which is why
    ``ADMINISTRATIVE_OPERATIONAL`` is ``"administrative-operational"`` and not
    the snake_case used elsewhere in this module — CHAR's registry validates
    class ids as kebab-case and this enum is the contract for those ids.

    Deliberately unanchored for now: ADR-015 open item 5 defers minting
    ``ashcai:SystemClassScheme`` until the second class's ids are final, since a
    notation fixed in the data plane (ADR-006) is expensive to split. Declared
    ``PENDING`` in :mod:`.bindings` so the gap stays visible.

    ``EHR``, ``ENTERPRISE_SYSTEM``, and ``AGENTIC_PLATFORM`` were added for

    bucket.
