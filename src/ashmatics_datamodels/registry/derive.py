Derivations over the registry vocabularies (ASHFORGE-412 AC-2 / AC-3).

Five quantities that older specs treated as stored fields are defined here as
pure functions instead, so the registry stays the single written source and
every consumer computes the same answer:

- ``clinical_use`` (SRS-REG-03's boolean) — derived from the category triad;
- ``system_class`` (CHAR's ``{{system.class}}``, ADR-015) — derived from the
  same triad, collapsed two ways instead of to a boolean;
- the obligation triad (SRS-REG-15a) — derived from the sourcing channel;
- ``ai_portfolio_size`` — derived from the active-entry count;
- ``ai_sourcing`` (org-level) — derived from per-system obligation values.

Invalid vocabulary values raise ``ValueError`` rather than degrade — the same
fail-loudly posture as the AC-4 guard.

    The second reading of the stored :class:`RegistryCategory` triad, beside
    :func:`is_clinical_use`. Both collapse the same three values; they differ
    only in what they collapse to, because they answer different questions —
    ``clinical_use`` asks whether an obligation attaches, ``system_class`` asks
    which body of CHAR content applies. Keeping both as derivations is what
    stops "is this system clinical?" acquiring a second stored answer.

    ``CLINICAL`` maps to :attr:`SystemClass.CLINICAL`; ``OPERATIONAL`` and
    ``ADMINISTRATIVE`` both map to
    :attr:`SystemClass.ADMINISTRATIVE_OPERATIONAL`, which is ADR-015 open
    item 1's deliberate single id. If that id later splits, this function
    widens and no stored entry is touched.

    back to a class: CHAR content defaults to ``core`` in the absence of a
    class (ADR-015 D3.1), and inventing ``administrative-operational`` here
    would silently apply one class's specializations to an unclassified system.
